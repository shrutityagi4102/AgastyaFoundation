Care for Patients is a saline tracking system website which I developed as part of Agastya Foundation and JPMC's School Challenge. 

I volunteered at Raje Sambhaji Vidyalay and mentored aa group of 5 students who developed AquaAlarm a device to track saline levels. Along with developement of hardware, I also helped them build care for patients which is a website which helps patients track saline levels

## Problem Statement :
Saline plays a major role in replenishing lost fluid, extracellular fluid replacement like dehydration, hypovolemia, haemorrhage, sepsis. Generally, Surveillance of saline bottle levels is monitored by nurses and caretakers. There is an endless need to check saline level after a particular time. If level of saline kept unsupervised and falls below the desired value for a prolonged time can prove to be lethal for a patient so there is no margin for error.

## Our Solution :
Help Nurses and Hospital Staff using :
- Aqua Alarm : Hardware device to help nurses track saline levels 
- Care For Patients : A Software based website as well as app to help nurses track saline levels
