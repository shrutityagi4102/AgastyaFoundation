Care for Patients is a saline tracking system website which I developed as part of Agastya Foundation and JPMC's School Challenge. 

I volunteered at Raje Sambhaji Vidyalay and mentored aa group of 5 students who developed AquaAlarm a device to track saline levels. Along with developement of hardware, I also helped them build care for patients which is a website which helps patients track saline levels

We won 3rd Prize at 2023 School Challenge organised by JP Morgan and Agastya Foundation, for presenting our hardware as well as software solution

## Problem Statement :
Saline plays a major role in replenishing lost fluid, extracellular fluid replacement like dehydration, hypovolemia, haemorrhage, sepsis. Generally, Surveillance of saline bottle levels is monitored by nurses and caretakers. There is an endless need to check saline level after a particular time. If level of saline kept unsupervised and falls below the desired value for a prolonged time can prove to be lethal for a patient so there is no margin for error.


UNDP Sustainability Global Goal being Targeted : Goal 3 which is Good Health And Well-Being

## Future Scope :
- Launching the App on Playstore

- Connecting sensor data to our website and app using ESP 32

- Using Machine learning to predict when next dose will be needed for patients and determining shortage of medicines from inventory
