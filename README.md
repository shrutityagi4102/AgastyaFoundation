# AgastyaFoundation - NGO

Care for Patients is a saline tracking system website which I developed as part of Agastya Foundation and JPMC's School Challenge. 

I volunteered at Raje Sambhaji Vidyalay and mentored aa group of 5 students who developed AquaAlarm a device to track saline levels. Along with developement of hardware, I also helped them build care for patients which is a website which helps patients track saline levels
